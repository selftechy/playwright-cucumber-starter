# cucumber-playwright-starter

A simple Playwright Cucumber framework to start with. I would call this as just a boiler plate code for someone who started learning playwright. One who knows Cucumber, not having much knowledge around Javascript/Typescript, etc can play around with this framework and learn Playwright. Reports folder consists of html report generated by executing the sample tests.  

## How to start

1. Clone the playwright-cucumber-starter
2. Run 'npm install'. This will install all the node modules into the project and ready to start writing tests.
3. Run 'npm run exec-tests' to run the sample test included and generate the html reports.
